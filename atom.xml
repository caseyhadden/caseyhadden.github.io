    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I left my house this morning, a group of deer appeared in an open area of the
yard. As my headlights illuminated the herd, they moved. Immediately, I saw them
frolicking. In the next instant, that perception changed. I saw them as they
were, panicked, racing around to avoid my car. Two deer stood at the rear,
safely watching the scene.</p>

<p>How often do we appear to do one thing (frolicking), while actually doing
something else (panicking), when we really should do a third (standing
still)?</p>

<p>How often do we look busy, accomplishing a task, when weâ€™re really racing,
trying to make something demonstrable, but we should be quiet, contemplative
about what our real objective is?</p>
