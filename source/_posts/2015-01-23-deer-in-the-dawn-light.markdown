As I left my house this morning, a group of deer appeared in an open area of the
yard. As my headlights illuminated the herd, they moved. Immediately, I saw them
frolicking. In the next instant, that perception changed. I saw them as they
were, panicked, racing around to avoid my car. Two deer stood at the rear,
safely watching the scene.

How often do we appear to do one thing (frolicking), while actually doing
something else (panicking), when we really should do a third (standing
still)?

How often do we look busy, accomplishing a task, when weâ€™re really racing,
trying to make something demonstrable, but we should be quiet, contemplative
about what our real objective is?
