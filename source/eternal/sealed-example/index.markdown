Someone on reddit asked for an example of my workflow when using the sealed
sorting tool. To be clear, I don't consider myself particularly good, but I'm
happy to provide information for others to use as they see fit. I do like trying
to put the decks together, but it's possible I'm doing it all wrong :).

For this description, I'll be using my [week 2 pool](https://eternalwarcry.com/decks/details/G26bvYflBeU/chapter-22-sealed-pool-week-2)
for the September, 2018 sealed league. 

My goal with this process it to try and make observations about the pool and
learn bit by bit about what might be able to come together as a deck. I start by
pasting my pool into the tool and selecting the 2.5 value threshold. I've tended
to find that you're going to end up including those cards in your deck and you
can always copy just the cards you want at any particular point. To that end, I
start by copying all cards with a value > 4 (**bolded**) into the client. That
gives us this:

From this view, we can make the following observations:

1. Time and Justice have the most, followed closely by Primal.
2. The attachments and spells are good splash candidates if they don't end up
   being a main faction.
3. 8 power (Marisen) is a lot.
4. Triple influence (Carnosaur) is a lot.

Now, I want to expand the pool to look at everything > 3 (**bolded** and
*italicized*). That gives us this set of cards:

I think we can observe the following:

1. Time and Primal remain at the top, but overall our factions are relatively
   close in representation.
2. There are some additional splash candidates like Dark Return.

At this point, I like to take a look at the fixing available in the pool. If we
imagine a generic 2 faction deck with sigils as the only power sources, you're
likely looking at a 9/9 or 10/8 split as far as sources. Taking a look at the
fixing now can help determine where we might be able to get additional sources
for the main factions or where we might have free sources for a splash.

This pool has been blessed with fixing banners and strangers. We have:

1. 5 potential fire sources
2. 4 potential time sources
3. 7 potential primal sources
4. 1 potential justice source
5. 2 potential shadow sources

With that much fixing for FTP, we have a shot at a straight 3-faction deck. If
we're straight 3-faction, we probably aren't going to want to splash anything.
Taking our cards > 2.5 and pasting them into the client, then removing anything
not in FTP gives us:

Hidden off screen at the bottom are an Archive Curator and a Torch. This looks
doable to me. We have enough total units. There are enough 2-drops to try and get
on the board early. It might look like we have too many 2-power, but we can work
on that. At this point, I generally try and add sigils to get an idea of how
many cuts we're talking about.

{% img /images/eternal-with-sigils.png %}

The 'default' power count is generally 18. We've got a monument that would be
nice to have transmuted, so I've started with 19 power. It might be correct to
have 20 power with the monument and the 8 drop, but we can decide that later.
With these sigil counts we get the following source totals:

1. 9 fire sources
2. 10 time sources (including the monument which we might want as a unit)
3. 10 primal sources

Overall, we're at 52 cards, and therefore need 7 cuts to get to 45. The first
cuts I'd make are Flash Freeze, Levitate, and Humbug Swarm. To me at least, they
seem the least impactful. Next, I think we want to look at Sandstorm and Dispel.
They both cycle themselves, but Dispel help answer particular threats like
lifesteal, etc. more cleanly, so I'm inclined to cut Sandstorm. We've got 8
2-drops which is probably at least 2 more than we need, so I'll cut Blinkwolf
and 1 Hotblood Barbarian. Blinkwolf can be some virtual card advantage via Warp,
but there do tend to be quite a few pings in the format. For similar reasons, I
think we only need 1 barbarian. The last cut is tough, but I think it's Skyrider
Vanguard. We have 4 natural fliers with another 2 via Cobalt Acolyte and
Changeestik, but I don't think we necessarily need the +1 strength from Spark.

And that's a deck:

The last thing I typically do is to take the deck and put it into the [Eternal
Power Calculator](https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc) and checking out the
influence and power possibilities.

{% img /images/epc-power-odds.png %}

It shows about what we'd expect. We've got a reasonable shot (70%) at our double
influence. Our chances at TTT for Carnosaur and 8 power are considerably less
good. For me personally, that's the type of tradeoff I tend to make in sealed -
give up a little consistency at the very top end if I have other possibilities
lower as well. This deck seems to have that with its earlier units, fliers,
weapons to buff them, and enough removal to get through opponent threats. We'll
see this week.

Addendum:

I remained curious about how much power should be run for a deck with an 8-drop +
a transmuting monument. To that end, I asked about it in the #leagues channel on
the Eternal discord. The folks there are great at helping people out. In my
conversation with NorthernPolarity from the TDC team, we concluded that I probably
didn't need to be quite so deep in Primal. By cutting back to the best, single
primal influence cards, I could just depend on the 6 free Primal sources in the
deck via banners and strangers. This would allow me to up the Fire and Time sigil
counts and which would be beneficial both to possibly casting Oni Ronin on turn 1
as well as hitting TTT in a reasonable timeframe. I ended up playing the deck
below to a 7-3 record on the week.

With the 8-2 from a 3F FTP deck in week 1, that left me at 15-5 overall:
