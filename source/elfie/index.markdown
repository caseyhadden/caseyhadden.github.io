### Bad News everybody! The post office here at the North Pole has been completely swamped!

I've been called in as an emergency helper to make sure everything gets done on time. I had
to send my girlfriend this year instead. If everything works out and the post office breaks
just right, she should get there sometime this week. I'm so sorry as I really look forward to
messing up your house every year. Don't worry though, I shared some of my best ideas with
her before she left!

Merry Christmas!

Here's one of my old favorites:

#### Goodbye and see you next year!

I used your Daddy's computer to make my own web page. This seems like a
fun place to explore when I come back next year!

Santa helped a bit with the code and the picture!

### Update: 23Dec2016

I've been taking classes back at the north pole to learn how to program the
computer just like your Dad.

<button onclick="changeColor()">Click me!</button>

<div id="elfie-target" style="elfie-target" style="background:#ffffff;height:200px;width:50%">
Check out my skills!
</div>

It's not perfect, but I'm learning!

Here's a couple of pictures of my friends working in class.

<script type="text/javascript">
function changeColor() {
  var colors = ["#ffffff","blue","red","yellow"];
  var rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*colors.length);
  $('#elfie-target').css("background-color", colors[rand]);
}
</script>
