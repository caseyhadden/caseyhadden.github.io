One evening we arrived home with stars visible in the night sky.
[Orion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_\(constellation\)) was just peeking
over the tree line. We'd recently attended an event at 
[Morehead Planetarium](http://www.moreheadplanetarium.org/) where they mentioned this
particular constellation, and I took the opportunity to point it out to the family.

The youngest, 2 years old, couldn't make sense of my description. He believed I'd seen a
lion and was understandably scared. The middle child, 4 years old, dutifully fulfilled her
role as an older sister and trying to explain it. She kept repeating, "No, it's not
a'rion, it's a'rion." Translation: It's not a lion, it's Orion. The oldest, 7 years old,
understood it all. She understood what I was communicating as well as where her siblings
were falling down.

* How often does the audience lack the maturity to understand our message?
* How often is the our delivery of the message too immature to understand?
